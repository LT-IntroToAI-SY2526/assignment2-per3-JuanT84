# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

What was difficult for me personally was knowing what new functions did exactly what I needed. An example was the ".join" feature. I instead was trying to push two lists into one like in java. This was somewhat difficult but after some AI help and looking it over I managed to understand overall what each section does.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

We could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database by matching certain aspects such as movies, dates, actors, directors and using this to set up a pattern database which would have pre programmed responses based on the paattern of words used.
